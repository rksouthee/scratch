# Scratch

These are various programs I've written for fun or learning.

## Tom's Data Onion

This was my attempt at Tom's Data Onion programming puzzle. More information
can be found in the directory `toms_data_onion`.

## Binomial Queue

This is an implementation of a [Binomial Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap) using
an interesting data structure. I first saw this data structure in a lecture given by Alex Stepanov
where he mentioned that a binomial queue could be implemented with this technique.

The program requires the code from [Elements of Programming](http://elementsofprogramming.com/).

## EWD924

I watched a video of a lecture given by [Edsger
Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) where he
demonstrated a beautiful algorithm for computing both the greatest common
divisor and lowest common multiple. I went to learn more about the algorithm
and found [EWD924](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD09xx/EWD924.html)
where Dijkstra mentions the Game of Stanley Gill. I wrote an article,
[The Game of Stanley Gill](https://rksouthee.github.io/2019/06/28/the-game-of-stanley-gill.html)
that proved the correctness of the algorithm.
