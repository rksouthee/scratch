# Scratch

These are various programs I've written for fun or learning.

## Tom's Data Onion

This was my attempt at Tom's Data Onion programming puzzle. More information
can be found in the directory `toms_data_onion`.

## Binomial Queue

This is an implementation of a [Binomial Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap) using
an interesting data structure. I first saw this data structure in a lecture given by Alex Stepanov
where he mentioned that a binomial queue could be implemented with this technique.

The program requires the code from [Elements of Programming](http://elementsofprogramming.com/).
