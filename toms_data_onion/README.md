# Tom's Data Onion

This is my solution to v1.0 of [Tom's Data Onion](https://www.tomdalling.com/toms-data-onion/).

If you want to run the code, then I suggest setting up a [Virtual
Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). With the virtual
environment set up, install the requirements. The module `aes-keywrap` needs
to be modified for Python 3.
